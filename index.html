    <p>The Riyadh Metro is one of the most ambitious public transportation projects in the Middle East. Designed to tackle the growing traffic congestion in Saudi Arabia’s capital city, the metro spans six lines covering around 176 kilometers and over 85 stations. The project is part of the city's broader Riyadh Public Transport Project (RPTP) aimed at transforming urban mobility, reducing traffic, and minimizing environmental impacts. It is a significant step forward in providing a sustainable and efficient means of transport for residents and visitors alike.</p>

    <p>Each metro line has been carefully planned to serve key areas of Riyadh, including business hubs, residential neighborhoods, and universities. The system will feature driverless trains, state-of-the-art stations, and smart ticketing services, ensuring a modern and user-friendly experience. Notably, the stations are designed with cutting-edge architecture that reflects Saudi culture and heritage, blending tradition with futuristic design elements. Once fully operational, the Riyadh Metro will provide a reliable and eco-friendly transportation alternative, helping the city meet its Vision 2030 goals for a more connected and sustainable urban future.</p>

  <p>The Line is a groundbreaking urban development project in Saudi Arabia, designed to redefine the concept of city living. Announced as part of the NEOM initiative, The Line will stretch 170 kilometers across the northwestern part of the country. What makes it unique is its linear design — a city with no cars, no streets, and no carbon emissions. Instead, it will rely entirely on renewable energy, prioritizing sustainability and innovation in every aspect of its construction and daily life operations.</p>

  <p>The design of The Line aims to preserve 95% of the natural environment surrounding it, creating a harmonious balance between urban life and nature. The city will feature a revolutionary infrastructure where residents will have access to all daily needs within a five-minute walk. High-speed transit systems are planned to connect one end of the city to the other in just 20 minutes. With its futuristic vision, The Line is expected to attract millions of residents and visitors, offering an unparalleled living experience powered by advanced technology and sustainable practices. This ambitious project stands as a bold statement of Saudi Arabia’s commitment to shaping a smarter, greener future for urban living.</p>
